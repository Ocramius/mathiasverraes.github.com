I hadn't done any presentations or blog posts about Command/Query Responsibility Segregation yet, even though I've been
working with it for more than year (and have been wanting to use it for another year). [Volker Dusch](https://twitter.com/__edorian)
invited me to speak at the first [ResearchGate Developer Day](http://news.researchgate.net/index.php?/archives/181-ResearchGate-Developer-Day.html) in Berlin,
and offered me the luxury to choose any SE topic I wanted, I just had to do it.

Volker gave me a tour of the ResearchGate office. They're all about sharing scientific research. It's a fast growing
startup, with an awesome culture, and [they're hiring](http://www.researchgate.net/careers/), so check them out.
