In [How to Read More Books](/2012/12/how-to-read-more-books/), one tip is about keeping a list of books you've read. So far, I haven't been able to find a personal library app that I really like. And: I don't like to rate books. It's such a static thing to do. You typically do it right after you've read the book, and never change it. 

Some books are great reads, but you forget about them after a while. Other books need time to ripe in your mind. Only after a few months, or even years, you start to grasp them fully. Or you notice how they've affected your thinking over the years. 

So here's an experiment: a list of books, ordered by the influence they've had on me, and reordered whenever I feel like it. My hope is to make this a living document, a snapshot of my current affection with a book, with the git log as a record of the evolution.

The rules:

- Only books I've read.
- Only good books: even a book at the bottom is worth reading -- it's just not so influential to me right now.
- No fiction, even though fiction can be just as influential. Ok, maybe some fiction will make the list if it's relevant.
- Academic papers count, blog posts don't. Just drawing the line somewhere.

I spend a lot of money on books, so most links here are Amazon affiliate links. You might just help fund my next purchase!
