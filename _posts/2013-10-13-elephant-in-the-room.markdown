I had some really great discussions with Konstantin aka
[@everzet](http://twitter.com/everzet) at Symfony Live London and PHPNW13. We both feel that topics such as architecture,
design, code quality, testing, and DDD, are not being discussed sufficiently in the PHP world. So we recorded our very
first podcast at [ElephantInTheRoom.io](http://elephantintheroom.io).

I only started listening to podcasts quite recently, but it's actually a much nicer medium than I would have expected.
As a friend told me: they are like blog posts you can listen to while driving.

So check out our podcast and let us know in the comments over at [ElephantInTheRoom.io](http://elephantintheroom.io) what you think.
