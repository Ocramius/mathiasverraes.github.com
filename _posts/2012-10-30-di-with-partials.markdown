My gut reaction when writing Javascript, is to try and mimck patterns and concepts that I'm used to in
class-based languages. Turns out Javascript allows you to do a whole bunch of things differently, and, dare I say it,
more elegantly. All you have to do is let go of the luggage you bring from languages like Java or PHP.

Say we want to handle some commands. In classical OOP, we'd start by making a `CommandHandler`, and give it one public method
called `handle(command)`. Our method is probably going to have some services it depends on, like a Repository. We inject that
into the class' constructor. (Note that in javascript, passing `repository` as a parameter will automatically bring it into scope
in `handle()`).

Elsewhere, we create an instance of the `CommandHandler` -- for example when we set up a dependency injection container.
And again elsewhere, we call the `handle` method on our instance.

{% highlight js %}
// CommandHandler Class
var CommandHandler = function(repository) {
  this.handle = function(command) {
    // do stuff with repository and command
  }
}

// Elsewhere, create an instance of the class...
var myCommandHandler = new CommandHandler(repository);

// ...and use it
myCommandHandler.handle(command);
{% endhighlight %}

### Going class-less

This sort of code is all too familiar, and it's perfectly valid in Javascript. But a couple of things bug me. First of
all there's the Noun.verb() combo. We're really only interested in one method: `handle`. Yet we have to have a class,
with an artificial name like `CommandHandler`, which is just a there to bring us the `handle` method.

A second quirk of class-based OOP, is that we need to have a class, as well as an instance of that class. I'm not saying there's
anything wrong with that, but after a couple of days diging into Javascript, it feels silly.

So let's get rid of the class, and keep only the verb, aka the `handle()` method. That means we now have to pass in the
`Repository` in some other way. We can pass it in as a parameter, but that's awkward, because then we'd have to have the
`Repository` object available everywhere we want the `handle()`, but that's too much internal information for client code to know.

### Partial functions to the rescue

Functional programming has a neat little trick that can be applied here. A partial is function that takes another function,
and 'pre-fills' a number of parameters. It returns a function that only needs the leftover parameters. Here's a typical
example:

{% highlight js %}
var sum = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

var addFiveTo = partial(sum, 5);

sum(5, 10) // returns 15
addFiveTo(10) // returns 15
{% endhighlight %}

Partials can easily be used to 'configure' a function in a DIC, and the use the pre-configured version of the function in the client code:

{% highlight js %}
var _ = require('lodash'); // Lodash is an API-compatible fork of Underscore.js

// The same as the first example, but as a class-less function
var handle = function(repository, command) {
  // do stuff with repository and command
}

// Elsewhere, inject the repository by creating a partial
var handle = _.partial(handle, repository);

// ...and use it
handle(command);
{% endhighlight %}

I'm still playing around with this kind of code, so I haven't decided yet if this is the approach I'll be using to replace
all single-method classes. In any case, Javascript's dynamic nature makes it easy to come up with many different ways of
doing this.

This looks nice. However, what you loose in cruft you also loose in clarity. In
the class-based implementation, a new developer can simply look up the class
definition to see the dependencies of a certain command handler. It seems to me
that with this partial-function approach a new developer has to look at the
handler implementation _and_ the DIC to validate what stuff gets injected. Not
sure if that's a trade-off I'd be willing to make.

If you're just writing client code, I don't think there's any added complexity.
In production code, you'd write something like `container.handleCommand(command)` instead of
`container.commandHandler.handle(command)`. I suppose you could do type hinting in an IDE
with annotations like JsDoc or Google Closure Compiler, so that should help reduce the clicking around.
But as I said, I'm stilling fooling around, I'm sure I'll get a better feel for what is practical and what is not.
