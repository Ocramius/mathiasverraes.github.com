Software design can have a very **slow feedback loop**: by the time you find out if the architectural and design decisions you made were the right ones, it may be too late for drastic changes. As developers, we tend to phrase all problems as technical problems, which can be sufficiently challenging in their own right. We tend to **lose sight of the underlying business concerns**.

Domain-Driven Design is **total approach to building software for complex domains.** It’s a way of thinking that helps you decide how to tackle complexity, and where to focus your efforts. By putting the business at the heart of our software, and keeping our domain model closely tied to our understanding of the business, we can create value at a much deeper level.

In this workshop, we’ll explore this central premise of Domain-Driven Design. We’ll take a practical approach: participants will be working on real-world problems. There will be **no easy answers**. Instead, you’ll learn how to ask the right questions, and how to evaluate different models.

*“For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.”* - Aristotle



## Contents

- Discovering the domain and the Ubiquitous Language through Model Storming
- Creating a model to share insights between both technical and non-technical shareholders
- Applying General Systems Thinking and problem-solving techniques
- Visualizing strategic design using Bounded Contexts and Context Mapping
- Integrating with brownfield systems

No more than 15 participants are accepted. By keeping the group small, everyone’s questions can properly be addressed. Lunch, snacks, and drinks are included.

## Testimonial

_“I spent three days immersed in the Domain-Driven Design world with Mathias. It was a great experience where I learned a lot about DDD. Mathias created an environment where we could interact all together experimenting with DDD. Furthermore Mathias adapted the workshop content dynamically to our needs and our concerns. It is a recommended experience!”_

-- Jordi Llonch, Technical Lead, Akamon Entertainment (Spain)

## About the instructor

Mathias Verraes is a recovering music composer turned programmer, consultant, blogger, speaker, and podcaster. He advises companies on how to build enterprise web applications for complex business domains. For some weird reason, he enjoys working on large legacy projects: the kind where there’s half a million lines of spaghetti code, and nobody knows how to get the codebase under control. He’s the founder of the Domain-Driven Design Belgium community. When he’s not working, he’s at home in Kortrijk, Belgium, helping his two sons build crazy Lego train tracks.

## Intended Audience

You are either a Software Developer, or a Business Analyst, Domain Expert, or Product Owner with a bit of technical background. You have some years of experience in working with complex domains.

## Participant Requirements

- Having read “Domain-Driven Design” (Evans, 2004) is recommended, but not essential.
- Laptops or other devices are not required, but useful for taking notes.
