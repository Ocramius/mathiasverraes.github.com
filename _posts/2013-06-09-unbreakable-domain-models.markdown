These are the slides for my presentation at the Dutch PHP Conference 2013 in Amsterdam. It's mostly code samples, the real meat
of the presentation was me ranting making your code as close as possible to the language of the business. I talked about
the importance of having your objects adhere to contracts with their surrounding collaborators. I hammered about avoiding
complexity, and only adding in additional flexibility if you have a good use case for it. I'll try to blog more about
the concepts I touched on.

All in all I think it went quite well, I only screwed up once, and I've been
getting a lot of amazing comments both [online](https://joind.in/talk/view/8438) and offline. If you are looking for
speakers for an event, or you need help with modelling or Domain Driven Design at your company, be sure to get in touch.

I'd like to thank the good people at iBuildings for organizing this conference, and for giving me the opportunity to speak.
The organization was flawless, they took great care of the speakers, and the atmosphere was very open and inspiring. Whenever
I talk to iBuildings people, I get the feeling that they have a wonderful company culture of learning and discovery.
