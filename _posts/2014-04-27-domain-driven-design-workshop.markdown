## Abstract

Software design can have a very slow feedback loop: by the time you find out if the architectural and design decisions you made were the right ones, it may be too late for drastic changes. As developers, we tend to phrase all problems as technical problems, which can be sufficiently challenging in their own right. We tend to lose sight of the underlying business concerns.

Domain-Driven Design is total approach to building software for complex domains. It’s a way of thinking that helps you decide how to tackle complexity, and where to focus your efforts. By putting the business at the heart of our software, and keeping our domain model closely tight to our understanding of the business, we can create value at a much deeper level.

In this workshop, we’ll explore this central premise of Domain-Driven Design. We’ll take a practical approach: participants will be solving real-world problems right away:

- Discovering the domain and the Ubiquitous Language through Model Storming
- Applying General Systems Thinking and problem-solving techniques
- Keeping our code in line with the domain model using tactical design patterns: Aggregates, Entities, Repositories, Value Objects, Specifications, Domain Events, ...
- Building according to architectural styles, such as Layered Architecture, Hexagonal, CQRS
- Visualizing strategic design using Bounded Contexts and Context Mapping
- Integrating with brownfield systems

Come and join a small group of developers (15 attendees) learning DDD in a hands-on workshop.

## Prerequisites

The workshop is not tied to any specific programming language. Good knowledge of object-oriented programming is required.

## About the instructor

Mathias Verraes is a recovering music composer turned programmer, consultant, blogger, speaker, and podcaster. He advises companies on how to build enterprise web applications for complex business domains . For some weird reason, he enjoys working on large legacy projects: the kind where there’s half a million lines of spaghetti code, and nobody knows how to get the codebase under control. He’s the founder of the Domain-Driven Design Belgium community. When he’s not working, he’s at home in Kortrijk, Belgium, helping his two sons build crazy Lego train tracks.
